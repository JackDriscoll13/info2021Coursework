Long ago, the four nations lived together in harmony. Then everything changed when the fire nation attacked. Only the avatar, master of all four elements, could stop him. But when the world needed him most, he vanished. 100 years have passed and my brother and I have discovered the new avatar, an airbender named Aang. And although his airbending skills are great, he has a lot to learn before he is ready to save anyone. But I believe, Aang can save the world.
